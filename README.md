# DSA Course Repository (C++)

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course repository! This repository contains various programs and exercises written in **C++** that cover fundamental topics in DSA. The code in this repository is designed to help students understand the core concepts and solve problems related to data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

This repository contains **C++** solutions to problems and assignments in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It is designed to provide students with hands-on experience with basic and advanced DSA concepts. The solutions are structured to enhance your understanding of the topics covered in your offline course, and to serve as a reference for solving problems.




### For Students:
- The repository is intended to be used as a **reference** to reinforce concepts learned during the offline lectures. You can look at each folder corresponding to a particular topic to understand how the algorithms and data structures are implemented in **C++**.
- **Work on assignments**: Try modifying the code, adding new features, or solving related problems on your own. This will enhance your learning experience.
- **Test your code**: Compile and run the C++ code in your local environment to see how the solutions work and experiment with different inputs.


Best of luck in your Data Structures and Algorithms course! Keep practicing, and you'll master the concepts over time!
